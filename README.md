# Welcome to the Repository of Group3 in Summer2025

## The Project
This project is part of the **PurePlate Initiative**, a global non-profit advocacy group focused on promoting food safety and raising awareness about emerging contaminants in the human diet. The primary objective of this analysis is **to investigate the growing presence of microplastics in our food supply** and explore their potential long-term health impacts.

Using a unique dataset on estimated microplastic consumption, this project aims to:

- Identify key trends in microplastic intake
- Pinpoint high-risk food categories
- Understand geographical variations in exposure

The findings will support public health campaigns, inform dietary guidelines, and advocate for stronger regulations on plastic production and waste management.
